# Hoist all packages to root node_modules for maximum compatibility.
# Required for Next.js on Windows with pnpm — without this, pnpm's
# symlink-based virtual store produces inconsistent drive-letter casing
# (e.g. "C:\..." vs "c:\...") which causes webpack to bundle the same module
# twice, crashing Next.js with "invariant expected layout router to be mounted".
